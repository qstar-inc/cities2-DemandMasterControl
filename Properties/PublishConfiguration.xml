# Demand Master
This is a very powerful mod.
It allows the player to modify a lot of parameters related to the demand system.
However, this is not an infinite demand mod where buildings get built but nobody moves in.

That being said I'm calling this an alpha mod, for now.
Everything works, that much is tested.
However, it is impossible to find every extremes cases.

This mod runs only during the simulation is running.
That being said, this mod does not touch your save.
All settings are global and players can use the button above to reset everything to vanilla in one shot.

As always, it is recommended to have reduntant save files just so if your city dies it can be recovered.
Also, make sure to have autosave on.

If you find a case where the simulation is crashing, please do reach out to me to fix those edge cases.
Enjoy!
